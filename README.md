# Electric Vehicle Market Segmentation Project

## Overview

The Electric Vehicle Market Segmentation Project aims to analyze and segment the electric vehicle (EV) market in India. By leveraging key variables and features, such as geographical location, vehicle type, price sensitivity, and charging infrastructure, the project seeks to create optimal market segments to better understand consumer behavior and preferences in the EV market domain.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Collection:** 
   - Data sources include industry reports, government statistics, and market research data on EV sales, consumer behavior, and infrastructure development.
   - Additional datasets may be acquired through partnerships with industry stakeholders and data providers.

2. **Data Analysis and Modeling:**
   - Utilizing machine learning algorithms and statistical techniques to analyze and segment the EV market based on key variables and features.
   - Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, patterns, and insights in the dataset.

3. **Market Segmentation:**
   - Segmenting the EV market based on geographical location, vehicle type, price sensitivity, and charging infrastructure.
   - Identifying optimal market segments to tailor marketing strategies, product offerings, and infrastructure development initiatives.

4. **Insights and Recommendations:**
   - Deriving actionable insights and recommendations for stakeholders, including automakers, policymakers, investors, and infrastructure providers.
   - Evaluating the effectiveness of segmentation strategies and potential implications for the EV market in India.
